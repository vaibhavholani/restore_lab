        title: "Participation and engagement needs of home care rehabilitation professionals transitioning out of the COVID-19 pandemic: A Pilot Study" , 
        funder: "Funded by: Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC)", 
        desc: "The COVID-19 pandemic has changed the way millions of Canadians live, work, and interact within their communities. Specifically, it has impacted the participation and engagement of Rehabilitation Professionals (RPs) working for homecare agencies, such as VHA Home HealthCare. Among the health professions studied in the stress and burnout literature, RPs have received little attention. This study aims to examine the nature of burnout and occupational stress among RPs at VHA Home HealthCare while they transition out of the COVID- 19 pandemic and evaluates the impact of burnout and occupational stress on participation at work.",
