            professor in the Department of Occupational Therapy and 
            Occupational Science, where he also holds the inaugural  
            Emily Geldsaler Grant Early Career Professorship in 
            Workplace Mental Health. Through an occupational lens, 
            his research program is a systematic study of occupations 
            in the areas of work disability prevention, return to work, 
            and disability management. 
            This approach is designed to produce results 
            directly applicable to identify and assess risk 
            and to develop interventions for preventing or 
            improving high-risk behaviours in the workplace. 
            Dr. Nowrouzi-Kiaâ€™s work is motivated by efforts in
            the field of work disability prevention that extends 
            beyond the efforts to prevent or cure diseases from a 
            purely physical perspective, towards more holistic approaches.`

I have been a practicing occupational therapist since 2001 with areas of expertise in  neuro-rehabilitation with a focus on Stroke, Multiple Sclerosis, Spinal Cord Injury and Acquired Brain Injury. I have been  practicing advanced, evidence-based interventions to treat and manage spasticity, with an emphasis on restoring function and improving quality of life. My doctoral work evaluated spasticity using combined kinematic and clinical outcome measures to assess the impact of BoNTA on arm function. My current research and clinical practice focus on patient and family goal-based intervention using the ICF model. My research interest areas are neuromodulation (sEMG, NMES/FES) coupled with traditional rehabilitation modalities such as exercise, massed practice, splinting/serial casting after upper limb paralysis or nerve transplant in individuals with Stroke or SCI. My post-doctoral fellowship at the University of Toronto was a multi-site randomized trial studying outdoor activities for seniors. I provide education in the Department of Occupational Therapy through  guest lectures, as a teaching assistant, lab educator and research supervisor for an OT student project.  During COVID-19, I have pivoted to providing assessment and treatment via telerehab to Toronto Rehab Spasticity patients. I am an active member of the peripheral nerve transplant team and act as research therapist in the Upper Extremity NeuroRestorative and Innovations Lab at Lyndhurst Centre.`
